Double precision Vector Libraries for Unity3D

This is a naive port of the Vector3 libraries in Unity to make them double precision, the intent is to have some data structures that are useful for internal world modelling that can be cast to regular Vector3 structures for rendering purposes.

The source is reverse engineered from the Unity codebase using Resharper, I contacted them directly as to whether it was okay to distribute this and they said it was fine.

This is a derived work, and as such no claim is made towards ownership.
