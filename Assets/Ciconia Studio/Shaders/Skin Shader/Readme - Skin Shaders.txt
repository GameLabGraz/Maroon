Readme - Skin Shaders
____________________________________


Important : The subsurface scattering effect is only available for Forward rendering path. You may experiment some visual issues using deferred rendering with Unity Post Processing Stack. 
In order that Unity Ambient Occlusion works correctly with the shader, don't forget to enable "Force Forward Compatibility" in the Post-processing profile.
