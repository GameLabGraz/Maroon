Version 1.4.7

Changelog:
1.0		-	Initial release.
1.0.1	-	Added web player link.
1.0.2	-	Fixed a display glitch with multiple bolts and very short duration.
1.1		-	Added an option to render lightning with a mesh that cuts down on the number of draw calls and CPU usage significantly.
1.2		-	Bug fixes.
1.3		-	Added a bunch of prefabs for shape lightning, chain / path lightning and more with demo scenes.
		-	Improved lightning bolt batching. Use CreateLightningBolts (plural) on LightningBoltScript to batch all bolts into one draw call.
		-	Lightning bolt script allows easily changing the glow and tint color, as well as texture without fussing with materials.
		-	10 new lightning bolt textures.
		-	Scene view shows gizmos for building lightning paths for better visualization - see DemoScenePath.
		-	Disabled legacy line renderer. It is still there, but #if'd out. I would suggest avoiding using this as I will probably delete
			it in a future version. The CPU usage and draw calls are terrible for this mode.
1.4		-	Bug fixes.
		-	You can specify point light intervals for your path lightning - useful for great lighting indoors.
1.4.1	-	At the top of LightningBoltScript.cs is an option to turn on "unsafe" mode. This allows assigning the lightning bolt geometry to the mesh without having to copy the array. This setting only works in deployed builds and not in the player.
1.4.2	-	Added parameter to LightningBoltScript that allows lightning to be limited in appearance by the current quality setting.
1.4.3	-	Fixed issues when reloading or changing levels. Sometimes lightning wouldn't render and disposed objects left over from the previous level would get accessed. This should be fixed.
1.4.4	-	Added world space vs. local space option in LightningBoltScript.cs. Default is world space. If you switch to local space, the start and end of the lightning bolt are assumed to be relative to the parent game object.
1.4.5	-	Added a turbulence parameters to the lightning bolt script. See DemoSceneLightningField for an example.
1.4.6	-	Added render queue parameter to lightning bolt script
1.4.7   -   Added a camera property to lightning bolt script. Default is current, or main camera if current is null. You are still responsible for setting the culling mask appropriately on your cameras.

- Configuration scene overview (DemoSceneConfigure)
This scene allows tweaking of many of the parameters for your lightning. Press SPACE BAR to create a lightning bolt, and drag the circle and anchor to change where your bolt goes.

The goal here is to get a style of bolt that will work for your game or app. Once you have a style you like, you can click "copy" in the bottom right. This will put a C# script on your clipboard which you can paste into your app. It will also put the current "seed" for the lightning into the text box in the bottom right which means the structure of your bolt will be the same each time it is emitted. This is great for cut-scenes or other scenarios where you have an exact style bolt you want. Simply click "clear" to get a random seed again.

The possible parameters are:
- Generations: The number of splits, or details in the lightning. Higher numbers yield higher quality looking lightning, at the cost of additional CPU time to create the lightning bolt. Usually 5-6 generations is good enough, unless you want really nice looking bolts, in which case 8 works great - but remember to only do this on capable hardware if you are generating lots of bolts. This value can be 0 for point light only lightning, otherwise it's clamped between 4-8.
- Bolt count: The number of lightning bolts to shoot out at once. There is a slight delay before successive bolts are sent out. This delay can be changed and will be a variable when you copy the script for your lightning bolt.
- Duration: The total time in seconds that the bolts will take to emite and dissipate. When sending out multiple bolts, each bolt will appear for a percentage of this time (about duration divided by count seconds).
- Start Distance: This moves the source of the bolt closer or further away from the camera. For best results, keep this close to the end distance.
- End Distance: This moves the end of the bolt closer or further away from the camera. For best results, keep this close to the start distance.
- Chaos Factor: As this value is increased, the lightning bolts spread out more and become more chaotic and cover more distance. In my testing, 0.1 to 0.25 are good ranges.
- Trunk Width: How wide the main trunk of the lightning bolt will be int Unity units.
- Forkedness: How many forks or splits will your lightning bolt have? If this value is 0, none. If it is 1, lots!
- Glow Intensity: How bright the glow of the lightning will be. Set to 0 to remove the glow.
- Glow Width Multiplier: Spreads the glow out more. Set to 0 to remove the glow.
- Fade Percent: 0.0 to 0.5, how long the lightning takes to fade in and out during it's lifetime (percent).
- Growth multiplier: How slowly the lightning should grow, 0 for instant, 1 for slow (0 - 1).

*Positioning and scaling the lightning*
If you are using world space coordinates (the default), the start and end coordinates are assumed to be in world space.
If you change to local coordinates, then your start and end coordinates are assumed to be relative to the parent game object.
For an example of local coordinates, see DemoSceneShape

*Scene view*
Here is how to rapidly prototype and design lightning in your scene:

- Drag one of the prefabs into your scene
- Press play
- Tweak the values to your liking
- Copy the root game object of the prefab
- Stop play
- Paste in the new object
- *Important* The parent object and object with the lightning script attached should have position and rotation values of 0, and scale of 1. See the DemoScenePath for an example.

*Rendering*
LightningBoltScript.cs has a quality setting option. This can be:
- Use Script
	Whatever settings specified in the script will be used, regardless of quality setting
- Use Quality Settings
	The global quality setting determines maximum generations, light count and shadow casting lights. By default this will work with
	Unity's 6 default quality levels. If you have set up your own levels, you may want to re-populate the QualityMaximums of the LightningBolt class
	in LightningBoltScript.cs to be appropriate for your custom quality levels.

The lightning can be rendererd via two modes, configurable via a render mode property on the Lightning object in the prefab or on the LightningScript.cs code.
- Mesh renderer with line glow. The glow will follow the shape of the line. This gives a consistant glow size no matter the generation setting and follows the shape of each line segment.
- Mesh renderer with billboard glow. The glow will be a square with size of the length of the line. The glow will be much larger on smaller generations, and smaller for higher generations.

*Orthographic Cameras*
When generating lightning for an orthographic camera, the algorithm changes slightly and the lightning will look a little more spread out and varied because there will be no z direction. If the main camera is orthographic, the lightning is generated in 2D mode.

*Lighting*
Lightning can emit lights. See the LightningLightParameters class, as well as the DemoScenePath for examples of how this works. Please review the light parameter documentation carefully as lighting can impact performance.
See LightningBoltScript.cs and the maxLightCount constant to determine how many lights lightning can generate at maximum.

*Misc*
- LightningBoltParameters has a Random property. You can use this if you want to create a bolt that will look the same every time. Use the System.Random constructor that takes a seed property. The default is a new System.Random.
- Lightning glow can be expensive, so you may want to disable this on lower end mobile devices by setting the glow intensity or the glow width to 0.
- When parenting under a prefab object, please ensure that both the parent prefab and the object that the lightning script is on have a position and rotation of 0 and scale of 1.
- LightningBoltScript.cs, class LightningBolt has public static variables that control limits for lighting and forks and other global limits

This asset contains a lot of options and code, so if you are confused or need guidance, please contact me. I'm always happy to answer questions. Please email me at jjxtra@gmail.com and I'll be happy to assist you.
