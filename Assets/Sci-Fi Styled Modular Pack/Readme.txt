|  COLOR PALETTE                            |
+-------------------------------------------+

All models have one base material. If you want to change a color palette for all of it, just change Albedo texture in "base material".

If you want change color pallete, just drag and drop selected material to prefab. But remember, since some of the models have LOD Group attached, you have to change material for all models inside that prefab. For example:
   Prefabs/Floors/floor_2.prefab have two LOD models inside it: floor_2_LOD0 and floor_FOD_1. You have to change material for both.
