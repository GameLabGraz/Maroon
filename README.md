# Overview
Maroon is an interactive and immersive laboratory developed in Unity, a
game engine which allows to build and deploy a high-quality 3D environment across
mobile, desktop and VR platforms. The lab is designed to support the flexible integration
of different interactive learning experiences.
To start a specific learning experience, the user can approach one
of those stations (illustrated with circular markers). From there the user can teleport to a new
room which represents the specific learning experiences with the learning content,
simulations, or experiments.

The following conceptual overview of the different versions of Maroon (Maroon Desktop, Maroon Room-Scale VR, Maroon Mobile VR and Maroon
Multi-User) illustrates the different forms of engagement Maroon supports or plans to support.

# Simulations and Experiments

Maroon contains several phisics experiments, but will be extended with computer science simulations and experiences from other subjects in the future. The physics experiments cover Van de Graaff Generator, Falling Coil, Faradayâ€™s Law, Capacitor and Huygen's Principle.
